<p>If you are looking for a way to try out a restaurant without any longtime commitment, a pop-up restaurant is one solution. Some professional chefs open their own pop-ups to build their culinary reputation, since the short-term nature of a pop-up allows chefs total freedom and creativity in the kitchen. Others open a pop up restaurant to test out a restaurant concept, using it as an avenue to entice investors as well as the public to try it out. On a more philosophical note, other people use pop up restaurants as a way to offer gourmet dining at reduced prices, so everyone can enjoy it. Lastly, pop-ups are sometimes used as a vehicle for fundraising by civic and community groups. </p>

<p>Another hugely popular restaurant concept are food trucks. These mobile eateries are popular for a variety of reasons: they have low start-up costs, low labor costs, and little overhead. Starting your own food truck still requires many of the same steps as opening a new restaurant. You need a business plan, financing, a menu, equipment, and good name. A trademark of a food truck business is the use of social media to announce where the truck is each day.</p>
